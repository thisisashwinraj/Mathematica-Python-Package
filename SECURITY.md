## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report security vulnerabilities by email to `thisisashwinraj@gmail.com`.

If the security vulnerability is accepted, a patch will be crafted privately
in order to prepare a dedicated bugfix release as timely as possible (depending
on the complexity of the fix).

In addition to sending the report by email, you can also report security
vulnerabilities as [ISSUES](https://github.com/thisisashwinraj/Mathematica-Python-Package/issues).
