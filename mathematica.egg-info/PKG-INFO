Elxsi is a python package for performing advanced mathematical operations, distributions, and visualizations, and is licensed under the [GNU General Public License v3.0](https://github.com/thisisashwinraj/Elxsi-Mathematical-Python-Package/blob/main/LICENSE). It includes modules for calculating mean, standard deviation & probability distribution function of various statistical distributions. The latest released stable version of elxsi is v1.0.4

This project was started in 2021 by [Ashwin Raj](https://www.github.com/thisisashwinraj), as an academic project. The resources for this package, and the pull requests are maintained, and reviewed by a team of volunteers from [Workspace](https://github.com/workspacedevelopers). Learn more about elxsi v1.0.4 [here](https://codeinplace.stanford.edu/2021/showcase/436)


# SubDirectories and Dependencies
### Dependencies
- Python (>= 3.9.0) - Learn more about the python programming from [here](https://www.python.org/), and download the latest version [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- NumPy (>=1.20.3) - Learn about the NumPy package [here](https://numpy.org/), and install the package following the guidelines [here](https://numpy.org/install/)

**Note:**
Elxsi runs on all operating systems, is quick to install, and is available for free use. No versions of Elxsi supports Python 2.7, and Python 3.4. Elxsi's plotting capabiliies requires [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) (>= 2.1.1) and seaborn (>= 0.9.0) packages.

### Files and Folders
The directories, and subdirectories used, that are of critical importance to the Elxsi python package are as mentioned:
- [dist](https://github.com/thisisashwinraj/Elxsi-Mathematical-Python-Package/tree/main/dist): This sub-directory contains the entire source distribution for the package that needs to be uploaded to PyPi
- [elxsi.egg-info](https://github.com/thisisashwinraj/Elxsi-Mathematical-Python-Package/tree/main/elxsi.egg-info): This subdirectory contains the entire package's metadata, including a PKG-INGFO, and the sources
- [elxsi](https://github.com/thisisashwinraj/Elxsi-Mathematical-Python-Package/tree/main/elxsi): This subdirectory contains the entire code for performing operations and visualizing statistical distributions

# Python Package Build Commands
To install the elxsi python package, just run the following command to create an .egg file (python distribution format):
```
python setup.py bdist_egg
```
To create raw source distribution file for this package, run the following command in your command prompt/terminal:
```
python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
```
Running this file creates the following sub-directories: dist, and elxsi.egg-info. Executable installer can also be created for installing the package in the Microsoft Windows environment. 
To create an executable installer, run this command:
```
python setup.py bdist_wininst
```
# User Installation and Source Code
Latest stable release of elxsi can either be downloaded from the repo or be simply installed from PyPi, using the code:
```
pip install elxsi
```
Once this package has succesfully installed, a large array of different statistical distributions can be imported from the package by specifying the name of the distribution (seprated by a ','), with first letter of each word typed in uppercase

![pip install elxsi](https://github.com/thisisashwinraj/Elxsi-Mathematical-Python-Package/blob/main/doc/gifs/elxsiReadmeGIF.gif)
